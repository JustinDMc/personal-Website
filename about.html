        <div class="about-body">
        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Daniel McArthur, I'm 23 years old
            living out of Santa Ana, CA. I have my B.S. from the University of Utah
            and I'm currently enrolled with FlatIron
            as a full time software engineering student. </p>

        <p>I aim to update this website as I develop professionally, hence 
            the very amateur build of the website thus far (just beginning to 
            learn.) I've taken introductory HTML, JavaScript and CSS and am eager
            to learn more about all of them! Most confident in HTML and most work on 
            improving goes towards JavaScript.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I love playing video-games and exploring the beaches 
            around the California coast. I also have four siblings; two older brothers,
            an older sister, and a younger brother, so keeping track of all of them is a 
            full time job in itself!</p>    

        <p>As a practice in incoprorating JS... 
            <script src="script.js" class="about-js"></script> </p>
